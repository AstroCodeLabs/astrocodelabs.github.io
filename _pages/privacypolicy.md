## Overview
Messier Journal helps you catalog and track Messier objects and optionally store photos and notes. We designed the app to collect **as little personal data as possible**. Most data stays **on your device** and under your control.

## What We Collect
- **Account data:** None. The app does not create or require an account.  
- **Personal data:** None is collected by us. Information you enter (e.g., notes, observation metadata) is stored locally on your device.  
- **Photos & media:** If you choose to import or save images, they are stored locally in the app’s storage and/or your Apple Photos library **only when you choose to export**.  
- **Analytics / tracking:** We do **not** use third-party analytics SDKs or advertising trackers.  
- **Diagnostics:** We do not collect diagnostics. Apple may provide us with **aggregated, anonymous crash reports** if you opt in to share diagnostics with developers in iOS settings; these do not identify you.

## App Permissions & How They’re Used
- **Photos (Library) Access:** Used to read images you select for import and to **save collages/exports** to your Photos library—only when you request it.  
- **Camera Access (if enabled):** Used solely to capture images inside the app—only when you initiate capture.  

You can change permissions anytime in **Settings → Privacy & Security** on your device.

## Where Your Data Lives
- **On-device by default.** Your notes, selections, and app settings are stored locally.  
- **iCloud/Photos (optional).** If you save images to Apple Photos or back up your device with iCloud, Apple’s services will hold copies according to your Apple settings and Apple’s privacy policy.

## Sharing & Selling of Data
- We **do not sell** your data.  
- We **do not share** personal data with third parties.  
- If required by law (e.g., valid legal process), we may disclose information we have (which is typically none beyond aggregated diagnostics if provided by Apple).

## Children’s Privacy
Messier Journal is not directed to children under **13** (or the age required by your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., EU/EEA, UK, California), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data. Because we do not collect personal data on our servers, requests typically involve information stored on your device. If you need help exercising a right, contact us at **[https://astrocodelabs.github.io/support/](AstroCodeLabs Support)**.

## Data Retention
Data remains on your device until **you delete it** or uninstall the app. If you exported items to Apple Photos or other locations, delete them there separately if desired.

## Security
We rely on iOS’s built-in security and your device safeguards. Please use a device passcode/biometrics and keep your OS up to date.

## International Transfers
We do not transfer your personal data to our servers. If you use Apple services (e.g., iCloud), refer to Apple’s policies for any international data handling.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on our website and the “Last updated” date will change.
